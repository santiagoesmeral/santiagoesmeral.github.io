    There is no Easter Bunny, there is no Tooth Fairy, and you cant have a single button with more than one interactive function!

    HTML5 specifies that no interactive element may be nested inside another interactive element. 
    aka no <button><button/></button>

    So instead, we make 2 buttons, and we make them look as if they are one, using absolute positioning or clever border stuff.

    To remember: a lot of people have problems clicking on small buttons. Dont do the zoom button thing! buttons should be fat and big. And with labels if possible.

    The idea for the address: 
    implement a list of buttons, each with a direct redirect and a copy to clipboard small button inside.

    here's a rough concept of the layout:
    where-button-goes: [direct-link | copy]

    and have a list of all of those.
    Some of the buttons wont have a copy and will instead be a direct redirect, so keep that in mind.
