    todo: i found a way that seems good-enough to implement mobile
    screen.orientation.type
    will return portrait if the device is portrait (vertical), or landscape if the device is landscape(horizontal).

    This will, of course, make a couple of problems: mainly that the page will default to the normal website if the phone is put on landscape mode (flipped horizontally)
    This is also a problem for tablets. So i need to test and implement the necessary fixes to make the website more suited for those devices.

    1- rework the button game a bit. Maybe only show the "click me if you can" if the screen isnt touch. And if it is, add a new game about clicking as soon as you can.
    2- rework the whole thing about the hints. They wont work well for mobile or tablet users (cant hover over things if there's no mouse). Maybe a button with a popup? not sure.
    3- when on portrait mode, remove the fun box, and adjust the grid, as well as adjusting the hire me page
