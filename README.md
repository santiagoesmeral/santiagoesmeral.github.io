# Hey

If you're reading this, you're checking out a different branch than main.

I kept this branch because i had 2 elements that i spent a lot of time working on that didnt make it in the main page, and i didnt want to remember the exact commit of when i deleted them. So instead i branched main right before deleting them.

The 2 elements in question are: TypeWriterTitle.tsx and Signature.tsx (and their respective scss files)

I will at some point in the future re-upload them in a codepen as they are something i am proud of. But for multiple reasons (complexity or simply not having a place to put them that would look good) they didnt make the cut in the main page.

Anyways, this branch is most likely out of date if you're reading this. You've been warned!
